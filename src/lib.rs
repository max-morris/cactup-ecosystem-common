//! Code shared across the Cactup ecosystem: the `cactup` CLI on users' machines and the
//! Cactarium registry.
//!
//! - [`sim`]: `.sim` files, which hold a parfile together with the thornlist it ran on, both kept
//!   verbatim, plus per-repo pins.
//! - [`manifest`]: `cactarium.toml` (a package) and `cactarium-stack.toml` (a stack), committed
//!   in a repo and read at each tag.
//! - [`stack`]: stack definitions (flat thornlist, recipe, or both) and frozen releases.
//! - [`ccl`]: dependency facts from a thorn's interface.ccl and configuration.ccl.
//! - [`crl`]: the CRL 1.0 thornlist parser (shared with cactup).
//! - [`name`], [`version`], [`slug`]: owner/name identifiers, track-namespaced semver, and the
//!   `owner/name[/Thorn][@...]` references users type.
//!
//! Every format carries a top-level `format` generation. Readers are strict: unknown keys are an
//! error, and a generation newer than this crate knows is rejected with an upgrade message (the
//! same discipline as cactup's MDB generations).
